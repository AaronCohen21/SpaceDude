# The Mis-Adventures of Space Dude!

This was one of the first ever major coding projects that I worked on. I created this game in the seventh grade as a way to get more familiar with Unity and programming as a whole. The game has simple controls, click on the buttons to start and choose your class, then click and hold to fly.

# An Important Note

I've had problems trying to import this into unity when cloning the repository. If you are trying to play the game in the unity editor make sure to open the 'Start Screen' scene.
